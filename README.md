# JS Reactive Framework Test
Some years ago, during a job application process, I was asked to create a HTML reusable component without using any 
external library or reactive framework... So, based on [this idea](https://medium.com/@iamwill.us/yet-another-post-about-creating-components-with-es6-vanilla-javascript-e57eca42f611) 
I tried to develop my own JS reactive "framework". 

Reactive "framework": classes/component.js

Component: js/multiSelect.js

Examples: 
* test.1.html: simple example of how to bind states (you can see it working [here](https://www.miltonlaufer.com.ar/reactiveframeworkjs/test.1.html))
* index.html: the component I had to create for the job (you can see it working [here](https://www.miltonlaufer.com.ar/reactiveframeworkjs))

This is how the component looks like:
